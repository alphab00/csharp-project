This is a csharp project made by alpha Balde and bobby chen. The objective of this project is to implement 2FA demo for a bank and sending a message with a code that has to be put back into the page to give an indidivual access into their bank account. The reason this project is important is because it helps is simulating how to add aditionally secuirty unto important private information. Since we were missing a team member, the professor helped with sampling the sms portion of the project. Bobbys job was to work on the controller page(s). The work for Alpha was to write out the page in which one would have to enter the 2FA code and then outputting a result of wether or not the code was accepted or not.
